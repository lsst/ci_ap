This is a metapackage to run ``ap_verify`` on the Alert Production CI datasets, including cosmos_pdr2, hits2015, and dc2.
The primary purpose of this package is to allow easy testing of AP pipeline and configuration changes; if you want to run an individual ap_verify dataset, we recommend running them directly, per these instructions:
 https://pipelines.lsst.io/v/daily/modules/lsst.ap.verify/running.html

``ci_ap`` is a package in the `LSST Science Pipelines <https://pipelines.lsst.io>`_.
